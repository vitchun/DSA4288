However, this becomes practically impossible if the number of states is very large or we havef a continuous state. One example would be the position and velocity of a car moving up a mountain - the state, represented by the position (x,y coodinate) and velocity of the car are continuous and the number of states is basically infinite. Hence, in such problem, we cannot use a Q-table to store the Q-value.\n","\n","Therefore, we use a function, parameterized by $\\mathbb{w}$ to approximate the Q-value of all the states. This function can be a linear function (taking the form of $Q(s,a; \\mathbb{w}) = \\mathbb{w}^T \\phi(s,a)$) or a (deep) neural network. Here, we represent our states using a feature vector $\\phi(s,a)$.\n","\n","The key idea is that instead of memorizing the Q-value for every possible state-action pair, we learn a mapping that generalizes across similar states. For example, if two states share similar features (say the car is moving slowly uphill in both cases), the function approximation allows us to assign similar Q-values without having to visit and store both states explicitly. This generalization is what makes function approximation powerful in large or continuous environments (but can also be hard to find a good function that can approximate q-values correctly for all states)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Update rule\n","\n","Recall that in standard Q-learning with discrete states, the update rule is:\n","\n","$$\n","Q(s,a) \\leftarrow Q(s,a)+α[r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s′,a′)−Q(s,a)]\n","$$\n","\n","When we use function approximation, we replace the Q-table with a parameterized function $Q(s, a; \\mathbf{w})$, where $\\mathbf{w}$ are the parameters (weights) we need to learn.Therefore, the goal is to find parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ that minimize the difference between the current Q-value estimate and the target Q-value.\n","\n","The temporal difference (TD) error for a transition $(s, a, r, s')$ is:\n","\n","$$\n","\\delta =r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s′,a′;w)−Q(s,a;w))\n","$$\n","\n","Instead of updating a table entry, we now update the parameters $\\mathbf{w}$ to reduce this error. Specifically, we want to optimize $\\mathbf{w}$ to make $Q(s, a; \\mathbf{w})$ closer to the target $r + \\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \\mathbf{w})$.\n","\n","One way to do that is to use Gradient Descent (or variants of it). The loss function for a single sample is:\n","\n","$$\n","L(w)=\\frac{1}{2}[r+\\gamma \\max_{a'} Q(s′,a′;w)−Q(s,a;w)]^2\n","$$\n","\n","The gradient of this loss with respect to $\\mathbf{w}$
